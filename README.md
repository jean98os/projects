# Projects

These are some of my Data Analyis projects.

🐦 CryptoTwitterSentimentAnalysis - this a sentiment analysis of cryptocurrency tweets from the first of January 2022 until today - I created visualisations that conveyed the polarity of tweets and some word clouds. 

📊 Untitled.ipynb - I explored crime reports from NYPD and created visualisations to better understand the information, I used sociological theory to analyse the visualisations further.
